## Access to the dashboard

Accessing the dashboard is hosted from the server's IP address.
My server is using IP 192.168.1.10
You can choose anything that you'd like, my router uses DHCP pool of 192.168.1.11 - 192.-> .254
So that way I always have the same IP Address, my server doesnt have access to internet so it monitors my network locally.
