# Installing new clients to monitor (Windows)

After installing centralized monitoring tool you can install clients/agents
These agents will report to the server and then the server will inform you if anything has happened.

To install new agents you click on "Wazuh" and "agents"

1. After this you will choose what operating system you want to download the agent to
2. The server address is the IP address where the server is hosted, mine is 192.168.1.10 as I told before accessing the dashboard
3. Optionally you can give the agent a name so you know which system's agent is giving alarms or other notifications.
